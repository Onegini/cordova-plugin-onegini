# Instructions to upgrade to Cordova plugin version to 8.0

This chapter describes the steps to take in order to migrate Cordova plugin to 8.0

## SecureXhr

If you are uing `secureXhr` flag and `XMLHttpRequest` api please update `load` and `error` handlers. Cordova Plugin from now on will correctly map the 400+ error codes as `load` events instead of  `error` events. `error` events will still be called when the request was not sent. Error object will be available under the `detail` key within the event object.
